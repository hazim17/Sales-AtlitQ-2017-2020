Data Discovery:
Sales management system <--> MySQL ---ETL---> Data Warehouse --> Dashboard


Data warehouse:
- Take data from MySQL (Online Transaction Processing System)

Data Transformation:
- ETL: Extract Transform Load

Data Cleaning & merging (Data wrangling / munging)

--------------------------------------------------------

Next, in power BI / Tableau, arrange the scheme of the data, to be a star schema.
We connect the relationship between transaction table and others table.

Create the dashboard.
