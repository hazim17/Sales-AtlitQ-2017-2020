# Sales-AtlitQ-2017-2020

I'm working on this project inspired by one of the Codebasics Youtube playlists:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3utcb9nKtanhcn8jd2E0Hp9b

I tried to make this as authentic as possible, This project used data from:
https://github.com/codebasics/DataAnalysisProjects/blob/master/1_SalesInsights/db_dump.sql

This project is created using MySQL through python, using MySQL connector,  to clean it and extract data to CSV. Then create the dashboard using Tableau Public.

Dashboard Result: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/m.hazim.mu.aafii/viz/DashboardSalesAtlitQ2017-2020/DashboardsalesAtlitQ2017-2020?publish=yes
